[Event Details](http://www.cscs.ch/events/event_detail/index.html?tx_seminars_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=143)

### Location
CSCS in Lugano, Switzerland

### Date
Thursday, September 29 and Friday, September 30, 2016

### Presenters
* John Biddiscombe, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS)
* Thomas Heller, Chair of Computer Architecture, Friedrich-Alexander University

### Abstract
The aim of this course is to introduce students to the HPX library and demonstrate how it can be used to write task based programs. The HPX library implements a lightweight threading model that allows both concurrent, asynchronous, parallel and distributed programming constructs to coexist within the same application with a consistent API based on C++ standards and using futures to synchronize between tasks.

The course is aimed at students with a good understanding of C++ and may be considered as an extension of the “Advanced C++ for HPC” course held during the first part of the same week. The material covered will include an introduction to the HPX programming model; asynchronous programming concepts, execution policies and executors; parallel algorithms using tasks (including the parallel STL); writing distributed applications with HPX; profiling and debugging and a final section
introducing heterogeneous programming using targets for GPU devices.

Attendees are required to bring their own laptops.
